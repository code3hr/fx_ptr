# fx_ptr &mdash; Machine Learning with Clear Code and Speed(to be implimented)
fx_ptr is machine learning lib that gives beginners the ability to practice on up to date ML algorithms

[fx_ptr] is an end-to-end library for Machine learning that focuses on clear code and speed. It is used and maintained in the [smrtptr]. This example shows how to use fx_ptr and where you can find more information.

  1. **Run a pre-trained Transformer**: create a translator in a few lines of code
  1. **Features and resources**: [API docs], where to talk to us, how to [open an issue](https://github.com/google/fx_ptr/issues) and more
  1. **Walkthrough**: how fx_ptr works, how to make new models and train on your own data

We welcome **contributions** to fx_ptr! We welcome PRs with code for new models and layers as well as improvements to our code and documentation. We especially love **samples** that explain how models work and show how to use them to solve problems!
